A simple pachinko-themed physics simulation, written with the help of SFML.

To see the code in action, you can simply run the executable (build/main.exe).

**Known Issues**
(These may get resolved at a later time, but for now, they're documented below for posterity)

- Sometimes, respawning balls will get stuck in the top-left corner of the screen.
- Occasionally (and seemingly only at the edges of collision sectors) two balls will stick together and stay "stuck" in midair, despite the constant force of gravity.
